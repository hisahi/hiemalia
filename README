Hiemalia is a vector-based three-dimensional tunnel flying/shoot 'em up (rail
shooter) game developed in (modern) C++. It is designed for the
University of Helsinki Game Project Course. Currently the game is an
early work-in-progress.

The project can be compiled in both GCC/Clang (with GNU Make) or Visual C++.
