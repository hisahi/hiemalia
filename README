Hiemalia is a vector-based three-dimensional tunnel flying/shoot 'em up (rail
shooter) game developed in (modern) C++. It is designed for the
University of Helsinki Game Project Course. Currently the game is mostly
finished, with only music and playtesting required to "go gold".

The project can be compiled in both GCC/Clang (with GNU Make) or Visual C++.
