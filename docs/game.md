_Hiemalia_ is a three-dimensional tunnel flying rail shoot 'em up, inspired by
games such as Nintendo's _Red Alarm_ (1995), _Star Fox_ (1993) and various
scrolling shmups by a multitude of different publishers. The game is styled
with vector-based graphics, such as those seen in Atari's _Tempest_ (1981) and
_Star Wars_ (1983).

The game has an arcade-like structure. There are four stages which are played
in order. After the fourth and final stage has been completed, the game simply
loops back to the first stage and only ends once the player gets a _game over_
and either is unable or chooses not to continue. There are two ultimate goals;
to complete all four stages at least once and to get the highest score. To this
end, the game has a high score system that records the score in addition to the
stage the player got the game over and the cycle (1 at first, 2 if all stages
have been completed once and so on). The difficulty increases slightly with each
completed loop.

There are seven player controls in addition to the pause button: movement
in all six directions: left, right, up, down as well as forward/backward which
control the speed at which the ship flies through the tunnels. In addition to
the movement controls, there is a simple fire button which fires a dual phaser
gun. The player is stuck with the gun and the ship they have from the beginning,
and no upgrade options are available. If the ship is hit by any bullet, it
careens out of control and inevitably crashes; hitting walls will cause it to
be immediately destroyed.

In addition to the shoot 'em up element, there are also obstacles that the
player has to avoid, such as sliding doors and moving blocks.

Points are collected by blowing up enemies, completing stages and doing so
as quickly as possible. There are also additional bonuses for every completed
loop (with an extra bonus if done without spending any continues) as well as
if no enemies other than bosses are killed during a stage.

The number of continues and the initial difficulty can be configured from the
game settings. See `settings.md` for more information.
